## 🗂 Dataset Information  
**File:** `Superstore Dataset.csv`  
**Key Columns:**  
- Order Details → Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode  
- Customer Info → Customer Name, Segment  
- Product Data → Category, Sub-Category, Product Name  
- Geography → Country, State, City, Region  
- Metrics → Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit  

**Feature Engineering:**  
- `Order_Year`  
- `Order_Month`  
- `Sales_to_Profit_Ratio`

## 📊 Analysis Performed  

### 1️⃣ Monthly Sales & Profit Trend  
- Identified peak business months  
- Found months with high sales but low profit due to discounting  

### 2️⃣ Year-over-Year Growth  
- Sales increased YoY  
- Profit fluctuated due to rising costs/discounts  

### 3️⃣ Regional, State & City Insights  
- **Top regions:** West & East  
- **Top states:** California, Washington, New York  
- Certain cities showed repeated losses  

### 4️⃣ Category & Sub-category Performance  
- Best Category → **Technology**  
- Worst Sub-category → **Tables (negative profit)**  

### 5️⃣ Customer Segment Analysis  
- Largest revenue segment → **Consumer**  
- Corporate also provides stable profit  

### 6️⃣ Shipping & Priority Insights  
- Standard Class = most used shipping mode  
- Faster modes cost more but boost satisfaction  

### 7️⃣ Sales-to-Profit Ratio  
Helps detect:  
- High-profit low-sales items  
- High-sales low-margin items

## 🧾 Key Business Insights

✔ **Top Categories:** Technology (Phones, Accessories)  
✔ **Worst Performer:** Tables → High sales, negative profit  
✔ **Top Regions:** West, East  
✔ **Growth:** Sales increasing yearly  
✔ **Recommendation:** Revisit discounting & supply chain efficiency  
✔ **Customer Insight:** Consumers = largest, most profitable segment

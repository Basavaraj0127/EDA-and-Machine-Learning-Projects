## 📘 Overview  

This project implements **RFM (Recency–Frequency–Monetary) Analysis** — a proven method used by marketing and analytics teams to evaluate customer value and predict engagement.  

It identifies different customer segments (like **Champions**, **Loyal Customers**, or **At-Risk**) using transaction data and visualizes these insights for better decision-making.

Built using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Seaborn**, this notebook is ideal for analysts and businesses looking to **enhance customer retention and campaign targeting** through data-driven segmentation.

## 🧠 What is RFM Analysis?

RFM is a data-driven technique used to evaluate customer behavior based on three dimensions:

| Metric | Meaning | Interpretation |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Recency (R)** | Days since last purchase | Lower = more active |
| **Frequency (F)** | Number of transactions | Higher = more loyal |
| **Monetary (M)** | Total spending amount | Higher = more valuable |

Each customer gets an **RFM score**, which can then be used for segmentation, targeting, or clustering.

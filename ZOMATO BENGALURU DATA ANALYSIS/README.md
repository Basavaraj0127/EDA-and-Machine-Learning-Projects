## 🚩 Problem Statement
The rapid expansion of the food industry in Bengaluru has led to an overwhelming number of dining options for customers. With thousands of restaurants offering diverse cuisines, it has become increasingly challenging for new entrants to stand out and for customers to make informed choices. While demand continues to grow, so does competition — making data-driven insights more crucial than ever.

This project seeks to explore which factors most significantly influence restaurant ratings on Zomato. By analyzing real-world data and applying analytical techniques, we aim to uncover relationships between attributes such as location, cuisine, cost, and customer ratings.

**The goal is twofold:**
- Help customers discover top-rated restaurants based on their preferences.
- Empower restaurant owners and marketers with actionable insights to improve their offerings and strategies.
